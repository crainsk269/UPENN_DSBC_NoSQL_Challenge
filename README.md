# UPENN_DSBC_NoSQL_Challenge

##### I enjoyed this challenge. I was able to reference the material from previous class lectures for the majority of the challenge. I did a few internet searches just to see if I could learn any additional information. I came across a new website that I found to be very helpful, database.guide. That's all I really have for this challenge.
